    "question": "Hey! I'm an undergrad student who's been getting into investing with the money I've saved up from my part-time job. I've got about $15000 saved up and I want to try out some trading strategies I've been learning about in my finance classes. My roommate told me about this thing called a Mean Reversion strategy and it sounds pretty cool! From what I understand, stock prices tend to bounce back to their average over time. One way to do this is with Bollinger Bands, basically using a moving average (like 20 days with 2 standard deviations) to create upper and lower bands based on how volatile the stock is. I want to test this out with Nvidia (NVDA) since I'm a CS major and I'm familiar with their GPUs. Can you help me figure out which would be the optimal day to buy from these dates: 2022-04-12, 2022-04-13, 2022-04-14, or 2022-04-15? I'm thinking of doing a quick day trade, buy at close on one day and sell at close three days later (like buy on 2022-04-14 close and sell on 2022-04-17 close) to see how this strategy performs. What kind of profit could I potentially make? Any help would be awesome. I'm trying to learn as much as I can about trading before I graduate!",
