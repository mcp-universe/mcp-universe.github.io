    "question": "Hi! My dad has been working really hard for our family, and I want to surprise him by learning about stocks so I can help him save money for when he gets older. I heard that some companies give money back to people who own their stocks, and they call these dividend payments. My teacher said that if a company has been doing it for at least 5 years, that means it's a really good company that takes care of its shareholders. I want to find 3 companies like this so I can show my dad that I'm learning about money and maybe we can invest together. Could you help me find 3 companies that have been giving dividends out for 5 years in a row? I think my dad would be so proud if I could teach him something about investing for once!",
