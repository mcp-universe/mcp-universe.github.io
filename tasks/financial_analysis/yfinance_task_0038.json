    "question": "Look, I'm broke and desperate here. I've been working dead-end jobs my whole life and I'm tired of being poor. I heard about this Price Breakout Strategy thing on some YouTube video and maybe it's my ticket out of this mess. From what I gathered, you look at the highest closing price in the last 20 days, and if the price today goes above that, you buy. If it drops 3% below the recent high, you sell. I scraped together what little money I have and I'm thinking about putting it all on Exxon Mobil (XOM). I need to know if December 1st, 2023 would've been a buy, sell, or hold signal with this strategy. I can't afford to mess this up. This might be my only shot at making it. Please help me figure this out, I'm counting on this to change my life.",
