    "question": "Hi there! I'm completely new to investing and finance, and honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by all the jargon and concepts. I've been trying to learn about something called 'fundamental analysis'. I think it has to do with looking at company finances? Anyway, I heard somewhere that you should look for companies where their net income (I think that's like profit?) has been going up for a few quarters in a row. I'm not really sure what that means exactly, but apparently 2 consecutive quarters of rising net income is a good sign? I'm still figuring out what makes a company worth investing in. Could you help a total beginner like me find 3 company tickers that have this pattern? I'm trying to learn by doing some basic research, even though I barely understand what I'm looking for. Any help would be amazing! I'm just trying to get my feet wet in this whole investing world!",
