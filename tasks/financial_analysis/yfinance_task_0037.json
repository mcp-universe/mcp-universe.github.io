    "question": "Hey there! So I'm an art student and my boyfriend is super into finance - like, he's always talking about options and volatility and all these complex financial instruments that honestly go way over my head. But I want to understand what he's passionate about so we can have deeper conversations! He mentioned something about 'implied volatility' and how it shows market emotions or something? I think he said high volatility options are really important for trading strategies. I'm hoping you can help me learn by finding an example - could you show me the out-of-the-money call option with the highest implied volatility for Salesforce (CRM) using the nearest expiration date? Maybe if I can understand a real example, I'll finally get what he's so excited about when he talks about the markets!",
