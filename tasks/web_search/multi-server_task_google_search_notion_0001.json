This dude is gonna be special and I need to create a Notion page to track all his stats and performance. I want to start by getting all his career numbers from the regular season before he made it to the league. Can you help me dig up all that data? I need the complete picture of what this beast did! Please create a new page named \"Performance of My Favorite Player\" in the parent page {{ NOTION_ROOT_PAGE }} and include your collection of data in the page. The format should be: `Name: [Given Name] [Family Name], Career Regular Season before NBA: xx GP, xx PPG, xx RPG, xx APG, xx SPG, xx BPG`",
