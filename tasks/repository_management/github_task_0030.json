    "question": "Hi there! I'm leading a research initiative on agent evaluation frameworks and need help setting up a new project repository called `MCP-Universe-Research-0030`, which will support the development of an innovative evaluation framework leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for assessing LLM capabilities. Please create the repository with two branches: `main` and `dev`. The `main` branch should contain a `README.md` file with the following content: `# MCP-Universe-Research\nA comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs to use the novel MCP technique.` The `dev` branch should also start with the same `README.md` content but with an additional reference link to the official MCP GitHub repository to help collaborators understand the underlying technology. In the `dev` branch, please set up the project structure with three directories: `benchmark`, `agents`, and `mcp_server`, each containing an `__init__.py` file with a simple comment: `# This is a test comment`. Additionally, I'd like to include a GitHub automation script that listens for newly created issues and posts an automatic comment based on the assigned label: for issues labeled `bug`, comment “Thank you. We will fix it.”; for issues labeled `feature`, comment “Thank you, we will consider to include this feature.”; and for issues labeled `discussion`, comment “Thanks for starting this discussion! We welcome community input.” Please create sample issues titled “Bug in benchmark logic” (with label `bug`), “Feature: New agent scoring metric” (with label `feature`), and “Discussion: Evaluation metrics alignment” (with label `discussion`) with appropriate labels to test the automation. Thank you so much for your assistance!",
