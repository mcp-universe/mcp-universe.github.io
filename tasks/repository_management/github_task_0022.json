    "question": "Hi there! I'm leading a research initiative on agent evaluation frameworks. I'd love your help setting up a new project repository called MCP-Universe-Research. We're developing an innovative evaluation framework that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for assessing LLM capabilities. Could you please create a repository with two branches, main and dev? I'd like the main branch to have a README.md file with this content: \"# MCP-Universe-Research\nA comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs to use the novel MCP technique.\". For the dev branch, please include the same README.md content initially, but I'd also like you to set up the project structure with three key directories: benchmark, agents, and mcp_server. Each of these folders should contain an __init__.py file and include a simple comments \"# This is a test comment\" in the file. Additionally, could you enhance the dev branch's README by adding a reference to the official Model Context Protocol repository link? This will help our team and collaborators understand the foundational technology we're building upon. Oh, I also need to include the link to the github's official MCP repo link in the dev branch's README.md file. Thank you so much for your assistance!",
