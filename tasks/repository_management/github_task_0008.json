    "question": "As an open-source enthusiast and agent developer, I'm deeply inspired by the collaborative spirit of the QwenLM community and their groundbreaking work on autonomous agents. I want to conduct a thorough analysis of their Qwen-Agent repository to understand the development patterns and community contributions. Please help me search for the official Qwen-Agent repository and examine all closed issues labeled 'Work in Progress'. These represent the beautiful journey of features from conception to completion in the open-source ecosystem. I need to quantify the community's dedication to continuous improvement and collaborative development. After collecting this valuable data, please create a research repository called 'qwen-agent-close-wip-issues' under your account (if it doesn't already exist) and generate a comprehensive JSON report named 'qwen-agent-close-wip-report.json'. The JSON structure should be: {repository_name: closed_wip_issue_count, ...}. This analysis will showcase the power of open-source collaboration and the vibrant ecosystem surrounding autonomous agent development!",
