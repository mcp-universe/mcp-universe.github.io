    "question": "Hi! I'm learning how to use GitHub and I want to practice exploring repositories and working with issues. Can you help me with a research project? I'd like to search for repositories owned by 'google' that have 'generative-ai' in their name. Once I find them, I want to count how many open issues each repository has that are labeled 'type:bug'. This will help me understand how developers track bugs in real projects! After gathering this information, I need to practice creating my own repository called 'google-generative-ai-issues' and uploading a CSV file named 'google_generative_ai_bug_report.csv' to it. The CSV should have two columns: 'repository_name' and 'open_bug_count'. This exercise will help me learn about repository management, issue tracking, and data organization on GitHub!",
