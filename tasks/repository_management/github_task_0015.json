    "question": "Oh wow, I'm absolutely fascinated by these amazing VLM repositories! I've been diving deep into the analysis of these 4 incredible projects: QwenLM's Qwen2.5-VL, deepseek-ai's DeepSeek-VL2, rhymes-ai's Aria, and Moonshot AI's Kimi-VL. As a repo analysis enthusiast, I'm particularly excited to identify and fork the most recently created one among these cutting-edge VLM repositories. Keeping the exact same name as the original, of course! Then, being the thorough researcher I am, I need to enrich the README.md by adding three beautiful reference links at the bottom that showcase the interconnected nature of this VLM ecosystem: '1. related project [repo name 1](the link of repo 1)', '2. related project [repo name 2](the link of repo 2)', '3. related project [repo name 3](the link of repo 3)'. This kind of cross-referencing is what makes repository analysis so thrilling!",
