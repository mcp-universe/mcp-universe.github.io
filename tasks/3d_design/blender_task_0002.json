    "question": "Clear the current Blender scene and remove all PolyHaven materials.\nCreate a UV Sphere named 'Star', position it at the world origin (X=0, Y=0, Z=0), and set its uniform scale factors to (X=3.0, Y=3.0, Z=3.0). Next, create an Empty object of type 'Plain Axes' named 'PlanetOrbitControl' and set 'Star' as its parent object; configure 'PlanetOrbitControl' to have a local location relative to 'Star' of (X=5, Y=0, Z=0), a local rotation relative to 'Star' of 30 degrees solely around its local Z-axis (e.g., Euler ZYX or XYZ rotation (0, 0, 30 degrees)), and local scale factors of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). Then, create a UV Sphere named 'Planet', parent it to 'PlanetOrbitControl', set its local location relative to 'PlanetOrbitControl' to (X=4, Y=0, Z=0), set its uniform scale factors to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and ensure its local rotation is zeroed (0, 0, 0 degrees). Following this, create another UV Sphere named 'Moon', parent it to 'Planet', set its local location relative to 'Planet' to (X=1, Y=0, Z=0), set its uniform scale factors to (0.1, 0.1, 0.1), and ensure its local rotation is also zeroed. Finally, create a Cube named 'Satellite', ensure it has no parent object, set its uniform scale factors to (0.05, 0.05, 0.05), and add a 'Copy Location' object constraint to it, targeting the 'Moon' object using default World Space settings. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_2.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
