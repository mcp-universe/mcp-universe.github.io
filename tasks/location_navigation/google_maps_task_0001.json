    "question": "Hey! I'm so excited to plan an amazing road trip starting in 'Johor Bahru' and ending in beautiful 'Kuala Lumpur', and I would love your help to make it perfect! My plan is to drive through exactly 4 interesting cities between the starting and ending points. Could you please map out exactly 3 distinct driving route options for this journey? For these routes, could you also find exactly 2 convenient rest stops within those intermediate cities for each route (a total of 2 rest stops per route)? Additionally, I would love to catch some scenery, so could you please find exactly 2 scenic viewpoints within those intermediate cities per route (the cities of the viewpoints should be at least 1 city different from the cities of the rest stops per route), and tell me their elevations (a total of 2 scenic viewpoints per route)? I am really looking forward to seeing the options for this fantastic adventure!",
