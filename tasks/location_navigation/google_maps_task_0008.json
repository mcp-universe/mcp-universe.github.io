    "question": "Heyy! I'm a young girl from Africa and I'm super excited about my upcoming road trip adventure from 'Paris' to 'Nice'! This is like a dream come true for me I've always wanted to explore France! I'm planning to visit exactly 2 amazing cities along the way to make this trip unforgettable. Could you help me plan 2 different driving routes for this incredible journey? For each route, I'd love to find 2 beautiful scenic viewpoints in those intermediate cities where I can take amazing photos and enjoy the views, and please tell me their elevation too (so that's 2 scenic viewpoints per route total)? I'm so pumped and can't wait to see what awesome options you come up with for my French adventure!",
