    "question": "I'm excited to plan an amazing road trip starting in 'San Francisco' and ending in beautiful 'Los Angeles', and I would love your help to make it perfect! My plan is to drive through exactly 5 interesting cities between the starting and ending points. Could you please map out exactly 2 distinct driving route options for this journey? For these routes, could you also find exactly 3 convenient rest stops within those intermediate cities for each route (a total of 3 rest stops per route), making sure the rest stops are located along or very near the suggested driving paths? Additionally, I would love to catch some scenery, so could you please find exactly 3 scenic viewpoints within those intermediate cities for each route that are reasonably accessible from the routes, and tell me their elevations (a total of 3 scenic viewpoints per route)? Oh, I must visit friends in 'Coalinga' during my trip. I am really looking forward to seeing the options for this fantastic adventure!",
