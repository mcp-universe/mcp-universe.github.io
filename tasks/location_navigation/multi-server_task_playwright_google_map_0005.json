    "question": "I met a new friend from England. He told me that he comes from the city with a football team that only lost 10 matches in the 2024-25 season. He asked me to find the team on the website https://www.premierleague.com/. Please help me find the team. Then he will invite me to go to his city to watch a match with him at the stadium. Suppose that I will start from the stadium of one of the football teams that scored 42 goals in the 2024-25 Premier League season. Please help us find a hotel between these two stadiums that is at the midpoint for driving distance and has at least a 4.2 rating on Google Maps so that we can rest there.",
