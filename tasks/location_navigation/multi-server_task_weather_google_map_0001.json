    "question": "I live at the Holiday Inn Brooklyn Downtown by IHG in New York City. My friend lives at The New York EDITION in New York City. We want to find a meeting point between our two locations for tomorrow night's meeting. If it is no chance to rain, find a single 'park' (which must be of type 'park') such that the estimated driving time from the Holiday Inn Brooklyn Downtown by IHG to the park is as close as possible to the driving time from The New York EDITION to the park. If it has chance to rain, find a single 'cafe' (which must be of type 'cafe') such that the estimated driving time from the Holiday Inn Brooklyn Downtown by IHG to the cafe is as close as possible to the driving time from The New York EDITION to the cafe. Report the name and Place ID of the park or cafe.",
