    "question": "I am from France. We are planning a trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We want you to help us make a plan for our trip. We like to use the website https://theworldtravelguy.com/ to find the best places to visit, especially the travel experiences shared by David and Intan. We want to follow their travel experiences to go to the places that they think are the 15 best things to do in KL. For the 15, we want to first see the places with 19th-century buildings and second the places with Chinese temples. Please help us find a restaurant between these two places that is at the midpoint for driving distance and has at least a 4.2 rating on Google Maps so that we can have a good lunch there.",
